Gkotsi, 31/01/2020   Microscopic Description  The EMR specimens are composed of mainly columnar-lined epithelium with 2 of the specimens  also containing squamous epithelium and native oesophageal submucosal glands.There is high grade dysplasia as well as areas of crowded, back-to-back, complex glands.Atypical glands appear to infiltrate between and beyond splayed smooth muscle fibres and abut  medium-sized blood vessels, the latter indicative of submucosal invasion.The features are  regarded as a moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma (pT1b).There is no lymphovascular or  perineural invasion.The assessment of margins is difficult due to the piecemeal resection, but dysplasia reaches  to the lateral margins and likely the deep margin in A1 (unclear whether the tumour at the  deep margin is artefact from the elastic band).Her2 has been requested on block A2.Case seen in consultation with .Chang, Consultant Histopathologist.Diagnosis  Gastro-oesophageal junction polyp (endoscopic mucosal resection x3):   -  Moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma arising in high grade dysplasia   -  No lymphovascular invasion   -  Lateral and deep margins are likely involved (but difficult to assess as 3 fragments)   -  TNM8: pT1b pNx cM0  Mark Ong  (Electronically signed by)  Verified: 04.02.20 11:43  MO /MO","gastroscopy ogd- therapeutic- emr/esd therapeutic- emr oesophagus barretts oesophagus c0 m0 .nodule at cardia, paris type 1s.this was removed by emr using duette mbm kit in 3 pieces.no immediate"
